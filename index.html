            <p>I am Anna Warner, I am 24 years old and currently live in Richmond, Virginia. I was born and
                raised in a small town called Purcellville, which is 45 minutes west of D.C. I graduated from
                Loudoun Valley Highschool in 2012.</p>

            <p>From Loudoun Valley, I went on to complete my undergraduate degree in Geographic Science at James Madison
                University. I went into my freshman year declared as a Geographic Science Major, and after my first
                physical geograhpy class, I knew that is what I wanted to get my degree in. I graduated from JMU in May
                2016.</p>

            <p>After I graduated from James Madison, I moved back home to Purcellville for 2 years. I worked as a
                recepionist for an engineering firm in Leesburg, Virginia for one year, then landed a position as a
                GIS Analyst for my current company. I have been working for RES for a year and a half now.</p>
